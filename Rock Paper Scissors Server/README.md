Rock Paper Scissors Server

This was a project in Fundamentals of Distributed Systems.

Running Server C on one machine then running the client on another machine will connect the two. Server C will then
create a Server G where the client can play Rock Paper Scissors against a bot. Server C allows for multiple
game servers to be ran at the same time.

Code is designed to run on a UNIX machine.
